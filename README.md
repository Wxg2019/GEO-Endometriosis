# GEO-Endometriosis
# Trying to analyse the datas of endometriosis in GEO, including miRNAs, whole genome, transcriptome.
#step 1 getGEO by Geoqury package in R
#step 2 ID filter Limma package
#step 3 check the data
#step 4 set group and analyse DEGs
#step 5 annotaion by KEGG and GO in R or Cytoscape software with GlueGO mode

#step 6 for miRNAs, it needs to find out the trarget genes by miRNA database on line, such as miRTART, ....

#step 7 for multiple groups or datasets, it needs to merge the DEGs and to find out the common sinificant DEGs. And then use it in following annotation by  KEGG and GO in R or Cytoscape software with GlueGO mode.
